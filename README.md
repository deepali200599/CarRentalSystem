# 🚗 Car Rental System (Java Project)

This is a **Car Rental System** developed using **Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts**.  
The system allows users to rent cars, return them, manage customers, and calculate rental prices.  
It is ideal for learning **Java OOP + database integration + console / GUI-based application structure**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

✔ Practice **Object-Oriented Programming**  
✔ Learn **real-world Java application development**  
✔ Implement **CRUD operations with database**  
✔ Understand **modular & reusable code design**

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

This project strongly follows OOP principles:

### 🔹 1. Encapsulation  
Classes like `Car`, `Customer`, and `Booking` contain **private fields with getters & setters**.

### 🔹 2. Inheritance  
Common properties are reused using parent–child classes (if implemented, e.g., Vehicle → Car).

### 🔹 3. Polymorphism  
Method overriding / overloading used in booking & calculation logic.

### 🔹 4. Abstraction  
Interfaces / abstract classes used for defining common behaviors (optional based on your design).
